# Masterthesis2024_Degradation_of_Norwegian_wind_farms
This code is used for estimation degradation of Norwegian wind farms as part of a Master´s thesis written at NMBU the spring of 2024. The code is in jupyter notebook format.
There are several data sets used in the script;

-Wind farm data are retrieved inside the code. 
-External power curves and power coefficient curves are made from power curves of turbines online.

-Productiion data (2002-2003) are downloaded from NVE at url: https://www.nve.no/energi/energisystem/vindkraft/data-for-utbygde-vindkraftverk-i-norge/

-The climate data used in this thesis are ERA5 reanalysis data retrieved from Coperncius witth url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview;
